Design a modern Indian e-commerce mobile app UI similar to Meesho.
The home screen should include:
A clean top header with user profile photo, wishlist icon, and cart icon
A large search bar with placeholder text “Search by Keyword or Product ID” including voice and camera icons
Location delivery section showing pincode (example: Delivering to Krishnagiri – 635106)
Horizontal category icons with images (Saree, Home, Beauty, Kitchen Utilities, Men, Kids, Footwear, Women Innerwear, etc.)
Filter bar with Sort, Category, Gender, and Filters options
Product cards in a grid layout showing:
Product image
Discount percentage
Price with strike-through MRP
Offer tags like “Mall”, “Free Delivery”, “Special Offer”
Rating badge with star and review count
Countdown deal timer on selected products
Bottom navigation bar with Home, Categories, Mall, Video Finds, and My Orders icons
Use a white background, soft pastel colors, rounded cards, modern sans-serif fonts, and a clean, mobile-first UX suitable for Indian shoppers.
